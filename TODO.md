# I need to do the following things:

### LRM:
##### Done:
1. Implemented for single feature and single parameter (just a single weight).
2. Implemented for single featuire and multiple parameters (weight and bias).
3. Applied regularization to the parameters (L1 and L2).
4. Gradient descent using derivatives caluculation using analytical method, as well as numerical method (Just a way to calulate derivative).
5. Documentation of the mathematics behind the Multiple Linear Regression Model.

##### To do:
1. Implement Linear Regression Model for multiple features.
2. Implement a classification model.
3. A mathematics visualization of loss function. (A bowl like graph, a parabola in 3d)

### Clustering:
##### Done:
1. Implemented a simple clustering model.
2. Implemented a change where initial samples are choosen from the population itself.

##### To do:
1. A simple implementation for choosing the best clusterization.
