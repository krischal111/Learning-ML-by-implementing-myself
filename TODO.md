# I need to do the following things:

### LRM:
##### Done:
1. Implemented for single variable and single parameter.
2. Implemented for multiple parameters.
3. Applied regularization to the parameters.
4. Gradient descent using derivatives caluculation using analytical method, as well as numerical method.

##### To do:
1. Implement Linear Regression Model for multiple features.
2. Implement a classification model.

### Clustering:
##### Done:
1. Implemented a simple clustering model.
2. Implemented a change where initial samples are choosen from the population itself.

##### To do:
1. A simple implementation for choosing the best clusterization.
