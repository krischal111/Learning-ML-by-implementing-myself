# My ML journey

This is a repository for keeping record of me learning machine learning.

Here are some of the things that I've implemented and I am proud of:

### 1. [Visualizing gradient descent in jupyter notebook](Linear-regression-models/01-04-lrm-again.ipynb) 

I made this while I was (still probably am) leanring ML. Further, I had board exams 4 days away, so my brains were super sharp then (it still is, lol).

### 2. [Visualizing k-means clustering alogrithm in jupyter notebook](Clustering-models/03-01-K-means.ipynb)

I made this while I was learning more ML, (now into clustering). I am already into my board exams, I have already given 2 exams, and I have a super difficult exam tomorrow. And I am doing this. But tomorrow I am gonna do great in exam anyway. Wish me luck.

### 3. [Mathematics of the multiple linear regression model](Multiple-linear-regression-models/02-02-MLRM.ipynb)

I made this while I was trying to make sense of the mathematics of the Multiple Linear Regression Model. I was having hard time achiving more clarity in derivation of the gradient of the loss function. I tried to rigorously verify all the steps myself. My exams are over, and vacations have started. My exams were great btw.
