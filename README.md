# My ML journey

This is a repository for keeping record of me learning machine learning.

Here are some of the things that I've implemented and I am proud of:

### 1. [Visualizing gradient descent in jupyter notebook](Linear-regression-models/01-04-lrm-again.ipynb) 

I made this while I was (still probably am) leanring ML. Further, I had board exams 4 days away, so my brains were super sharp then (it still is, lol).
